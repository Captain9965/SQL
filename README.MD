# Databases: 
A database is a collection of data so that it can be easily accessed. 
To manage these databases, `Database Management Systems` are used (DBMS)
In general, there are 2 types of databases:
1. Relational
2. Non-relational

In non-relational, data is stored in key-value pairs. The most common ones used is: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra. 

In relational, data is stored in tabular format. In RDBMS, 2 or more tables may be related to each other, hence the name "relational" 

Commonly used RDBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle..
