# SQL SELECT:
This is used to retrieve data from a database table eg:
```
    SELECT first_name, last_name FROM <table name>

```
To select ALL, use `*`

## SELECT WHERE Clause:

The `SELECT` statement can have an optional `WHERE` clause that that allows us to fetch a record matching a specific condition. eg.

```
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE last_name = 'Lenny';
```
**N/B: Do not use ""**
